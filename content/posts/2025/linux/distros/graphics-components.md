## Key Components of the Linux Graphical Interface

Before we talk about drivers, it's important to understand how the main components of the graphical interface work on Linux.

<br>

**TL;DR:** In Linux, the DE provides the visual layer, the WM handles window placement, and X11 or Wayland manages communication between apps, the GPU, and the display server.

## Desktop Environment (DE)

The **Desktop Environment** includes everything you see and interact with in your daily use:

- the taskbar and system tray
- menus, notifications, and window design (style, animations, buttons)
- file manager, panels, widgets
- themes, icons, and fonts

**Ex.:** GNOME, KDE Plasma (my personal favorite), Cinnamon, Budgie...

Each one balances performance, aesthetics, and features differently.

## Window Manager (WM)

The **Window Manager** controls the placement and behavior of windows on your screen:

- layout modes (floating, tiling, monocle)
- keyboard shortcuts for moving and resizing windows
- window borders, shadows, and stacking order
- focus rules and workspace management

You can use the WM that comes integrated with your DE, or choose a standalone WM for more control and customization.

**Ex.:** i3, bspwm, Sway, Hyprland.

## Graphical Protocols

Graphical protocols mediate the communication between applications, the WM/DE, and the graphics hardware. On Linux, two main protocols handle this, each with its own pros and cons:

### X11 (Xorg)

- **Why choose it**
  - Excellent compatibility with a wide range of applications, desktop environments, and drivers.
  - Mature ecosystem with support for extensions, debugging, automation, and remote forwarding.
  - Recommended for legacy setups or when specific tools still require X11.

- **Potential drawbacks**  
  - Outdated architecture with extra layers that increase latency and complicate optimizations.
  - Limited support for HiDPI, multiple GPUs, and high refresh rate displays.
  - Security concerns: any app can listen to global input like keyboard and mouse events.

---

### Wayland

- **Why choose it**
  - Modern architecture with direct rendering, reducing latency and improving resource efficiency.
  - Isolated security model: apps can't access each other's input or windows.
  - Improved native support for HiDPI, fractional scaling, and screen rotation.

- **Potential drawbacks**
  - Legacy apps may still depend on X11, although XWayland provides partial compatibility.
  - Some advanced graphical tools and drivers still face limitations or instability.
  - Screen capture and recording can be limited depending on the compositor.

> **Quick tip:** Many Linux distros let you switch between Wayland and Xorg at the login screen. If something critical doesn't work properly on Wayland, just log back in with X11.

With these concepts in mind, you can fine-tune your compositor, protocol, and window manager to gain better control over latency, rendering, and GPU performance in your daily workflow.
